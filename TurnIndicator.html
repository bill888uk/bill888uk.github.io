cost DIY Turn/Direction indicator stalk for ETS2</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>First created 12 June 2025.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Rather than using the paddle shifters on my G29 wheel, I looked
into adding a Turn indicator stalk to my setup for as little money as
possible. I found when I returned to driving my real fully automatic
car, I often tried to use the optional paddle gear shifters to
operate the turn indicators....</P>
<P>I found a seller on AliExpress offering a low cost toggle switch
with a longer than normal metal lever. The switch is momentary toggle
switch. ie. It springs back to centre position when 'Off'.</P>
<P>I had a simple pedestal fixed to the desk, made from offcuts of
laminate flooring and furniture board for my keyboard which sits on
top of the G29 wheel base, so this made it straightforward to add the
Turn indicator stalk. It is within convenient reach using my fingers
without taking my hand off the wheel.</P>
<P>I have discovered if the stalk is too close to the wheel and
paddle shifter, you may accidentally hit the end of the stalk when
playing other sims such as F1. Through trial and error, I eventually
found the optimum position.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/ets5.jpg" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>It sits a few millimetre above the G29 base.</P>
<P>The pedestal for the keyboard is secured to the 'underside' of the
table, by using 'U' shaped bracket folded round the front edge of the
desk.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/ets1.jpg" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>This image shows hot glue covering the soldered electrical wires.</P>

</P>
<P>I used an arduino micro board, but you should consider using a
zero delay Arcade Controller. There are a few Youtube videos on the
subject. Here is one example</P>
<P><A HREF="https://youtu.be/33g99OzOkpk?si=ln9UdQ6jPsmEKhDx">https://youtu.be/33g99OzOkpk?si=ln9UdQ6jPsmEKhDx</A></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The arcade controller includes a long fly lead (black cable below)
with a standard USB-A plug. The controller is normally sold with
pre-made leads (blue and white wires below). In my experience of
using such cables in a different project, I found I had to solder the
leads to the switch contacts for reliable operation.</P>
<P>The blue coloured wires is 'common' electrical connection for all
the arcade controller inputs (I recall it may measure +5v but don't
quote me). Simply solder any one of the blue wires to the centre pin
of the toggle switch. Then connect two white wires to the remaining
two pins on the toggle switch.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/fs3.jpg" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The stalk is from a Gillette disposable razor. Blue plastic with
cyan coloured silicone finish. Simply cut off the end of the handle
to the desired length. Then drill two 2.5mm holes side by side to
create an elongated hole about 5mm wide.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/ets4.jpg" NAME="graphics20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>When sliding the stalk over the end of the toggle switch lever,
you MUST use needle nose pliers to hold the switch as shown below at
the base of the toggle lever. If you fail to do so, <B>you WILL
damage the internal centre return spring</B> if the lever is
deliberately pushed into the body of the toggle switch.</P>
<P>Apply hot glue into the voids to permanently attach the stalk to
the toggle switch lever.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/ets3.jpg" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>It is unlikely you will be able to find the same extruded
aluminium tube I found in my box of bits and pieces. An alternative
could be to simply use 75x75x16mm angle bracket. If you enlarge the
appropriate hole to 6mm, the toggle switch will fit nicely.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/ets6.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Windows will recognise the zero delay arcade controller. No
drivers required. Use 'joy.cpl' to see listed of connected
controllers. It will be listed as 'Generic USB joystick'. When you
operate the toggle switch, you will see the appropriate lamp light up
when using joy.cpl.</P>
<P>Within ETS2, you must enable the arcade controller. The you will
be able to bind the new Turn indicator stalk to the sim.</P>

<P>Here is a list of items I purchased from aliexpress:</P>
<P>I recommend using a Zero delay Arcade Game controller. I purchased
the 'Wiring 3' kit which I think came with 14 pairs of blue/white
connecting leads for use with a different project.</P>

<P>I recommend purchasing two in case you accidentally break it.</P>

<P>The zero delay arcade controller should just about fit inside this

<P>Please double check the dimensions. Alternatively, you could use
an empty margarine tub.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/ets8.jpg" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=173 BORDER=0></P>
<P>There are other cheaper alternative ABS boxes on AliExpress.
Please make sure they include screws for securing the lid. Otherwise,
cheap ABS boxes supplied without any fixing screws often require
miniature self tapping round head screws.</P>

</P>
<P>I was already using a zero delay arcade controller for Flight
Simulator on my PC. Adding a second arcade controller may lead to
confusion in Windows, so I opted to use an Arduino board for this
Turn indicator project, and learn more about Arduino.</P>

<P>I carefully drilled and filed a small aperture for the Arduino's
USB-C socket. To stop the arduino board being pushed into the box,
when the USB cable is inserted, I wedged an offcut of timber between
the other unsupported end of the arduino board and the internal wall
of the box, and applied a little hot glue.</P>
<P>A sketch (program) has to be uploaded into Arduino Micro. I used a
sketch I was already using for modifying Logitech Flight quadrant, to
save myself time and effort, searching for a simpler sketch:</P>

<P>My experience with Aliexpress has been positive since March 2024.
In past 15 months, I've made around 30 purchases. Majority of orders
were circa &pound;12 including VAT. Provided I choose items which
qualify for 'Choice delivery', they always arrive in 7 days from
China to the UK. Final delivery with the UK by Evri, and occasionally
Royal Mail.</P>
<P>I have had issues with a couple of orders. Either the items were
defective/damaged, or incorrect item was dispatched. They are very
low value items (eg. &pound;3 at most). There is no point contacting
the seller. I find it much easier to report problem to Aliexpress via
the Order page, uploading photos to explain the issue. Aliexpress
then refund within 24 hours without quibble. 
</P>
<P>Be warned for much higher value items, you may be asked to return
the item, and there is no guarantee refund will be forthcoming.
AliExpress does not have a UK legal presence.
