<P>Minor update Mar 2021 &ndash; The Power button has become
temperamental in past few years. I finally opened up the Sharp and
used Isopropyl alcholol to clean the contact and the rubber button.
It is better after cleaning. However, I had not realised until today,
the Sharp could also be turned on by pressing any of the buttons down
the left hand side of the display !</P>
<P>&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>If you own one of the old Sharp Wizards, you may have encountered
the problem where vertical or horizontal lines are missing. 
</P>
<P>My understanding of the problem from googling around, it is a
problem with the soldering of the flexi-cables to the LCD panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was wondering whether a DIY repair was possible.</P>
<P>I've not been able to find any instructions on how to dismantle a
7xx series Wizard so here is my unofficial guide which covers models
such as the ZQ-770 and OZ-770.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Look carefully and you can see a few missing vertical lines in
this photo.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq00.jpg" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The back of the LCD screen is actually clipped onto the front
bezel of the screen lid.&nbsp; If you carefully get your finger nail
(Don't do this if you have weak or brittle finger nails !) or a
guitar pick between the back/bottom edge of the screen cover and the
round hinge, you should see the two halves of the lid start to
separate.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq23.jpg" NAME="graphics22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Next, run your finger nail/blunt table knife/guitar pick tool
along the opening gap and it should separate further.&nbsp; There are
2 hidden clips.&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat exercise for the other side.&nbsp;
Now you can carefully lift the back cover away from the screen &ndash;
the top edge of the back cover should unclip easily from the front
bezel.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq01.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0><IMG SRC="images/zq02.jpg" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq03.jpg" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 BORDER=0></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq04.jpg" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0><IMG SRC="images/zq05.jpg" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq06.jpg" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 BORDER=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Note that the small tabs on the lid which fit into the arrowed
slots shown in above photos are fragile and one or more may break
off.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq07.jpg" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 BORDER=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At first I thought it was this dark brown flexi that was
responsible for the screen line problems.&nbsp; I tried prodding it
while the Wizard was switched on but it made no difference to the
display. (If you own a Psion 5mx PDA, the similar looking flexi is
notorious for breaking and causing all sorts of display faults)</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq08.jpg" NAME="graphics9" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 BORDER=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I eventually discovered this to be the offending flexi-cable if
your Wizard suffers from missing vertical lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
prod it gently while the the Wizard is powered on, you may see
vertical lines disappear or reappear.</P>

<P>The following describes how to dismantle the keyboard half of the
Wizard.</P>
<P>Remove the 6 screws as shown below.&nbsp; Now get a finger inside
the battery compartment and carefully start to separate the two
halves of the plastic in the vicinity of the compartment opening.&nbsp;
Once you have started to separate the two halves, run your finger
nail, or use a blunt table knife and continue along its length.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq09.jpg" NAME="graphics11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0><IMG SRC="images/zq12.jpg" NAME="graphics12" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq13.jpg" NAME="graphics13" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Repeat the exercise down the sides of the case and along the front
edge.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq11.jpg" NAME="graphics14" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0><IMG SRC="images/zq14.jpg" NAME="graphics15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once the two halves have started to separate, the battery
compartment lid latch is likely to fall out at this point !</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq15.jpg" NAME="graphics16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 BORDER=0></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq16.jpg" NAME="graphics17" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The other end of the screen flexi-cable is held in position by a
plate and 3 screws as you can see from the photos below.&nbsp; Once
the screws and plate is removed the flexi-cable lifts off.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq17.jpg" NAME="graphics18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0><IMG SRC="images/zq18.jpg" NAME="graphics19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>

<P>To separate the front bezel from the display PCB, remove the 10
black screws from the back of the display PCB.&nbsp; Each black screw
is marked with a white triangle on the display PCB. 
</P>
<P>Note there is a small bit of adhesive on the left and right edges
of the LCD panel, so be careful when attempting to separate the bezel
from the LCD panel! I used a guitar pick and carefully ran it down
the gap.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq22.jpg" NAME="graphics23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq20.jpg" NAME="graphics20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The flexi-cable along the top of the screen is responsible for any
vertical line issues.&nbsp; The flexi on the left hand side is
responsible for any horizontal lines.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/zq21.jpg" NAME="graphics21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=639 HEIGHT=384 BORDER=0></P>
<P>I am not able to progress any further in separating the LCD panel
from the PCB.&nbsp; The left hand side flexi cable needs to be
carefully detached from the PCB to allow the LCD panel to be folded
upwards and away from the PCB, to gain access to where the top flexi
cable is soldered to the PCB.&nbsp; I do not possess the specialist
tools that are likely to be required to carefully align and resolder
the flexi cables back onto the PCB.</P>
<P>As a result, my conclusion is a DIY repair is not possible.</P>
