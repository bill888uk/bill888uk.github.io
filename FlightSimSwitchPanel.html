cost DIY flaps control/switch panel for Flight Simulator</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>First created 12 June 2025.</P>
<P>I bought Flight Simulator 2020 and a new xbox series S in late
2023, only to quickly realise that xbox compatible flight yokes were
very very expensive. By spring 2024, I bought a MSI RTX 4060 ventus
graphics card and new Corsair ATX PSU to use with an old i5-8400 mini
tower PC.</P>
<P>I mainly fly GA aircraft such as Cessna 172 with steam gauges.</P>
<P>This blog describes how I added a 4 position flaps control lever
and switches on a shoe string budget.</P>
<P>Shown below is an old 3 pole 4 position rotary switch I bought
over 30 years ago. You can find them on aliexpress for less than 2
quid.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/fs5.jpg" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The lever is constructed from an old 35mm outer diameter plastic
knob. I cut off the hex head and I drilled a 6mm hole through the
side of the plastic knob. The M6 bolt is secured with two M6 lock
nuts.</P>
<P>The knurled collar is one end of a F plug. F plugs are available
to take either standard RG6 cable, or thinner shotgun cable commonly
used in UK for old Sky UK satellite installations. The thread appears
to be M6 for the shotgun F plug. Some glue may be required to stop
the collar from spinning loose.</P>

<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>To connect the rotary switch to the Windows PC, I used a zero
delay Arcade Controller. It includes a long fly lead (black cable
below) with a standard USB-A plug. The controller is normally sold
with pre-made leads (blue and white wires below). Note you may need
to buy additional leads. I found I had to solder the leads to ALL the
switch contacts for reliable operation.</P>
<P>You can use an arduino micro board, but the overall cost will be a
bit higher.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Windows will recognise the arcade controller. No drivers required.
Use 'joy.cpl' to see listed of connected controllers. It will be
listed as 'Generic USB joystick'.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/fs3.jpg" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>

</P>
<P>The toggle switches and push buttons are inexpensive from
aliexpress.</P>
<P>This was my original prototype.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/fs1.jpg" NAME="graphics20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The following images below show the final version in its stages of
construction.</P>
<P>Each set of leads comes with a blue and white wire. If memory
serves me correctly and studying image below, the blue coloured wire
is the 'common' lead. ie. Four white leads go to the rotary switch,
and just one blue lead from any of the leads goes to the 'common'
connection on the rear of the rotary switch.</P>
<P>The rotary switch is mounted on a piece of folded aluminium and
screwed/glued it to some discarded pieces of furniture board.</P>
<P>The 4 push buttons should be wired to the Dpad on the arcade
controller.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/fs4.jpg" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/fs2.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Back panel is cardboard I screwed and glued to the furniture
board.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/fs7.jpg" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The black textured steel panel is from a discarded PC. I used a
hand metal nibbler to cut the sheet to size. I didn't use a dremel or
other power tools because it would be messy/dusty. Folding the sheet
steel was extremely difficult and the textured paint cracked along
the fold. I touched it up with black permanent marker pen. In
hindsight, I would not want to fold the sheet steel.</P>
<P>Dremel and cutting discs used to help make the rectangular slot
for the flaps control lever.</P>
<P>The labels on the front panel is laser printed and attached with
3M magic tape.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/fs8.jpg" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The following images show how it is mounted without drilling any
holes into the 'top' of the desk. It overhangs the 1.8m wide desk
because I wanted to make best use of the space at the other end of
the 1.8m wide desk.</P>
<P>The Flaps ON/OFF switch seen below is used to 'disconnect' the
'common' end (blue wire) of the rotary switch signal coming from the
arcade controller. This gives me the option to use the Flaps Up/Down
lever on the Logitech Multi panel.</P>
<P>The two folded cut outs in the rear cardboard back panel, is to
provide access for the fixings to secure the Logitech multi panel to
the top of the DIY switch panel.</P>

<P>Here is a list of items I purchased from aliexpress:</P>
<P>Zero delay Arcade Game controller. I purchased the 'Wiring 3' kit
which I think came with 14 pairs of blue/white connecting leads.
Rotary switch requires 4 leads, push buttons requires 1 lead each,
and toggle switches required 2 leads. Total 16 required for my setup.
I had to improvise when I realised I was 2 leads short of required
16.</P>

<P>My experience with Aliexpress has been positive since March 2024.
In past 15 months, I've made around 30 purchases. Majority of orders
were circa &pound;12 including VAT. Provided I choose items which
qualify for 'Choice delivery', they always arrive in 7 days from
China to the UK. Final delivery with the UK by Evri, and occasionally
Royal Mail.</P>
<P>I have had issues with a couple of orders. Either the items were
defective/damaged, or incorrect item was dispatched. They are very
low value items (eg. &pound;3 at most). There is no point contacting
the seller. I find it much easier to report problem to Aliexpress via
the Order page, uploading photos to explain the issue. Aliexpress
then refund within 24 hours without quibble. 
</P>
<P>Be warned for much higher value items, you may be asked to return
the item, and there is no guarantee refund will be forthcoming.
AliExpress does not have a UK legal presence.
