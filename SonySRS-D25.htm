<P>I've owned this Sony 2.1 subwoofer PC speaker system since 2007.
In recent years, it had developed a background mains hum. Adjusting
the volume control does not affect the volume of the hum.</P>
<P>It was likely to be a bad capacitor issue given its age.</P>
<P>The main unit was easy to dismantle by first removing the 6
recessed screws. The front panel can then be separated. Remember to
unplug the blue ended ribbon cable to improve access.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/srsd25-1.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>The power amplifier board is clearly visible. Visual inspection
does not reveal any bulging or leaking electrolytic capacitors.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/srsd25-4.jpg" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Unfortunately, the board cannot be removed because the audio leads
passing through the rear of the case are hot glued in place !</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/srsd25-3.jpg" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>I didn't like the idea of trying to remove the glue or cut all the
audio leads to extract the power amplifier board.</P>
<P>The 11.4v AC secondary winding from the transformer is connected
to the circuit board shown below. I measured 13.5v AC across the blue
wires into the PCB. The bridge rectifier visible next to the 2 pin
socket suggests the board requires a regulated 16-19v DC supply.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/srsd25-2.jpg" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>I connected a bench power supply to the PCB and the hum
immediately disappeared. The SRS-D25 was able to operate down to 11v
DC. It cut out just above 10v DC.</P>
<P>I decided to bypass the existing transformer and simply power the
SRS-D25 from a new external DC power adapter. I didn't have any spare
15-20v DC power adapter, so I used an 'off the shelf' 12v @ 2A
switched mode power adapter.</P>
<P>I cut the primary and secondary leads off the transformer and
joined them together. Then installed the modified lead into the
SRS-D25.</P>

</P>
<P>Finally, I cut the AC mains plug off the end of the cable and
fitted a female barrel connector for the new external 12v DC power
adapter.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/srsd25-6.jpg" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=289 BORDER=0></P>
<P>At normal listening volume levels, audio seems fine. When I wind
the volume up to unacceptable levels, I haven't noticed any audio
'clipping'.</P>
<P>I also measured the DC voltage across the main subwoofer unit. At
18v, I measured 50-60mV. For 12v, there was only 32-40mV. ie.
Negligible DC bias.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Some notebook 19v power adapters from around 10 years ago didn't
have a 3<SUP>rd</SUP> 'sense/data pin. I may try and find a discarded
one to use with the SRS-D25. Toshiba used 19v power adapters with
regular 2.5 x 5.5mm barrel plugs. In the mean time, the 12v power
adapter seems to work just fine.</P>
<P>I've also observed when the SRS-D25 is plugged into my Dell
laptop, there is a very high pitch buzz or chirp when the volume
control on the SRS-D25 is at Maximum setting. There is no noise when
the audio cable is unplugged from the laptop. 
</P>
<P>I tested 5 different 12v power adapters &ndash; 3x 2Amp
plug-in-wall, and 2x 5Amp brick style. Three adapters produced a
noise. For one particular plug-in-wall adapter, the noise got louder
when I placed my hand on it or if I brought the adapter closer to the
laptop. Two other plug-in-wall adapters were silent.</P>

<P>I have discovered this video which shows the PCB can be partially
removed.</P>
